						<b>Summary</b> This map shows likely bike routes that Fort Collins children would use to ride to school. The 
						intent of this map is to highlight potential bike routes to schools, to make it easier to study deficient infrastructure 
						that might be deterring students who could otherwise ride or walk to school.
						</div>
						<div>
						<b>Methods</b> Each route connects the center of a census block with the nearest elementary school. Route opacity is 
						based on the number of people under 18yo in the census block. As routes merge their opacities add, so routes become opaque 
						closer to schools, representing a higher potential student bike traffic volume.
						<br/>
						Routes come from Open Route Service and are limited by distance since students who live more than 1 mile from school
						are eligible for bus service. Each census block is currently connected to the nearest school. This assumption isn't always
						correct and will be improved in due course.
